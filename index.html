        <h2>Ingredients For The Chow Main</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Hong Kong Style Egg Noodles: </strong>For the noodles you can use chow mein noodles, lo mein noodles, thick Hong Kong style egg noodles or thin egg noodles.</li>
            <li><strong>Scallions or green onions: </strong> trim the scallions and separate the white portion from the greens.</li>
            <li><strong>Sauces: </strong>You’ll need oyster sauce as well as soy sauce.</li>
            <li><strong>Red pepper flakes: </strong>You’ll need ¼ – ½ teaspoon of red pepper flakes. I also like to swap the red pepper flakes for ½ – 1 teaspoon of chili crunch.</li>
            <li><strong>Toasted sesame oil: </strong>it’s very important to use toasted sesame oil for this recipe. The 2 tablespoon of oil really provide a deep, toasty flavor to the noodles.</li>
            <li><strong>High heat oil: </strong>you can use canola, vegetable or avocado oil.</li>
            <li><strong>Mixed veggies: </strong>Use a simple bag of coleslaw mix with some shredded carrots for this recipe.You can also use broccoli slaw or baby corn for this recipe if you’d like.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Making Wok Fried Noodles</h2>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Start by boiling the noodles.</strong> Bring a large pot of water to boil. When the water is boiling, add the noodles and allow them to boil according to the cooking time listed on the noodle package. Drain the noodles and rinse them under cold running water. This will stop the noodles from cooking any further.</li>
            <li><strong>Chop the veggies.</strong> I usually use store-prepped vegetables for this recipe so that it really cuts down on the presswork. The scallions are the only thing I usually need to prepare. Cut them into 1-inch pieces then quarter the 1-inch pieces certainly so you end up with julienned scallions.</li>
            <li><strong>Make the sauce.</strong> In a small bowl, combine the oyster sauce, soy sauce, minced garlic, red pepper flakes, salt, and 1 tsp sesame oil. Set this aside for now.</li>
            <li><strong>Pan fry the noodles.</strong> Add equal parts sesame oil and high heat oil to the pan, then let it get screaming hot. Add the noodles in a single, thin layer and let them cook for several minutes until crispy. Give them a flip and then add more sesame and high heat oil and cook the other side. Remove the noodles to a plate.</li>
            <li><strong>Sauté the veggies.</strong> Add a drizzle of sesame oil and sauté the whites of the green onion, carrots, and cabbage. Then add the noodles back to the pan.</li>
            <li><strong>Sauce and serve!</strong> Drizzle the prepared sauce all over the noodles and toss them in the pan until they start to sizzle. Add the green onions and then serve it up with your favorite protein.</li>
